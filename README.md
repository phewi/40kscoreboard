# 40k Scoreboard
This little web application is for our wargaming group to display the score on a 1080p TV.

Use background image opacity 50% on top of a black background to see the text better

# Todo

- [ ] Reset button
- [ ] Add mission objective descriptions (mouseover or infobutton maybe)
- [ ] Add secondary objective descriptions (mouseover or infobutton maybe)
- [ ] Generate the dropdowns from json instead of hardcoding
- [ ] Conditional secondary mission dropdowns based on factions
- [ ] Design a sensible hotkey scheme that can be used with a wireless keyboard or numpad
  - [ ] Make the hotkeys work without focusing the window
- [ ] Mirror the background instead using more assets (maybe)
- [ ] Separate views for editing/viewing (maybe)
- [ ] Particle effects for bling (If a suitable one can be found)
